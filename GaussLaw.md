# Gauss's Law

## Flux
- $ \Phi = EA\cos\theta $

### Notes:
- Flux measures the "flow" of the electric field through a surface.
- For a uniform field perpendicular to the surface, $ \Phi = EA $.

### Example Problem 1:
A uniform electric field of $ 500 \, \text{N/C} $ passes through a circular area of radius $ 0.1 \, \text{m} $. What is the flux if the field is perpendicular to the surface?

**Solution:**
$$
\Phi = EA = (500)(\pi(0.1)^2) = 15.7 \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{C}
$$

## Gauss's Law Equation
- $ \Phi = \frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0} $

### Notes:
- $ \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/\text{Nm}^2 $: Permittivity of free space.
- Enclosed charge determines the total flux.

### Example Problem 2:
A spherical Gaussian surface encloses a charge of $ +2 \, \mu\text{C} $. What is the total flux through the surface?

**Solution:**
$$
\Phi = \frac{q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-6}}{8.85 \times 10^{-12}} = 2.26 \times 10^5 \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{C}
$$

## Applications
- Symmetric charge distributions.

### Notes:
- Use Gauss's Law for highly symmetric systems like spheres, cylinders, or infinite planes.

### Example Problem 3:
Find the electric field outside a uniformly charged sphere of radius $ R $ with total charge $ Q $.

**Solution:**
For $ r > R $, the field is equivalent to that of a point charge:
$$
E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
$$
