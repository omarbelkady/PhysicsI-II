# Electric Potential

## Definition
- $ V = \frac{U}{q} $

### Notes:
- Potential is a scalar quantity.
- Unit: Volt ($ 1 \, \text{V} = 1 \, \text{J/C} $).

### Example Problem 1:
What is the potential at a distance of $ 0.2 \, \text{m} $ from a $ +5 \, \mu\text{C} $ charge?

**Solution:**
$$
V = k\frac{q}{r} = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{5 \times 10^{-6}}{0.2} = 2.25 \times 10^5 \, \text{V}
$$

## Potential Difference
- $ V = Ed $

### Notes:
- Potential difference is work done per unit charge to move between two points.

### Example Problem 2:
An electric field of $ 200 \, \text{N/C} $ exists between two plates separated by $ 0.01 \, \text{m} $. What is the potential difference?

**Solution:**
$$
V = Ed = (200)(0.01) = 2 \, \text{V}
$$

## Equipotential Surfaces
- Regions of constant potential.

### Notes:
- Equipotential surfaces are perpendicular to electric field lines.

### Example Problem 3:
Why do equipotential surfaces near a point charge form concentric spheres?

**Solution:**
The electric potential depends only on the distance from the charge, so all points at the same distance have the same potential, forming spherical surfaces.
