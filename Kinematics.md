# Kinematics

## Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration
- Definitions and formulas:

$$
v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$

$
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}
$$

### Notes:
- **Displacement**: Change in position ($ \Delta x = x_f - x_i $).
- **Velocity**: Rate of change of displacement.
- **Acceleration**: Rate of change of velocity.

#### Key Concept:
- Positive acceleration increases velocity; negative acceleration (deceleration) decreases it.

### Example Problem 1:
A car accelerates from rest to $ 20 \, \text{m/s} $ in $ 5 \, \text{s} $. What is its acceleration?

**Solution:**

$$
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{20 - 0}{5} = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2
$$

## Equations of Motion

$$
v = u + at
$$



$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

$$
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
$$

### Notes:
- These equations apply to uniformly accelerated motion.
- $ u $: Initial velocity, $ v $: Final velocity, $ a $: Acceleration, $ s $: Displacement, $ t $: Time.

#### Practical Insight:
- Used in designing roller coasters, calculating stopping distances, etc.

### Example Problem 2:
A ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of 20m/s 
How high does it go? 
 
g = 9.8 m/s^2

**Solution:**
At maximum height, $ v = 0 $:

$$
v^2 = u^2 + 2as \implies 0 = (20)^2 + 2(-9.8)s
$$

$$
s = \frac{400}{19.6} \approx 20.4 \, \text{m}
$$

## Projectile Motion
- Horizontal and vertical components.

### Notes:
- Horizontal motion:

Constant velocity

$$
v_x = v_{x0} 
$$

- Vertical motion: Accelerated by gravity

$$
a_y = -g
$$

#### Key Concept:
- The path of a projectile is parabolic.

### Example Problem 3:
A ball is kicked horizontally at $ 10 \, \text{m/s} $ from a height of $ 20 \, \text{m} $. How far does it travel horizontally before hitting the ground?

**Solution:**

Vertical motion:

$$
h = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \implies 20 = \frac{1}{2}(9.8)t^2 \implies t = \sqrt{\frac{40}{9.8}} \approx 2.02 \, \text{s}
$$

Horizontal motion:

$$
x = v_xt = (10)(2.02) \approx 20.2 \, \text{m}
$$
