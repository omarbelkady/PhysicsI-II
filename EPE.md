# Electric Potential Energy

## Key Notes
- Electric potential energy ($ U $) is the energy associated with the position of charges in an electric field.
- For a point charge $ q $ in a potential $ V $:
  $$
  U = qV
  $$
- The work done to move a charge in an electric field is equal to the change in electric potential energy.

## Connection to Work and Energy
- Moving a charge against an electric field requires work, which increases its potential energy.
- If a charge moves freely in an electric field, its potential energy decreases while its kinetic energy increases (Conservation of Energy).

### Example Problem: Moving a Charge
- A charge $ q = 2 \, \mu\text{C} $ is moved from a point where the potential is $ V_1 = 50 \, \text{V} $ to another point where $ V_2 = 100 \, \text{V} $. What is the change in electric potential energy?

**Solution:**
$$
\Delta U = q(V_2 - V_1) = (2 \times 10^{-6})(100 - 50) = 1 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{J}
$$

### Real-World Application:
- Charging batteries: Chemical energy is converted into electric potential energy.
- Lightning: Potential energy builds up in clouds before discharge.
