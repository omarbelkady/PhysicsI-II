# Newton's Laws of Motion

## First Law (Inertia)
- An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force.

### Notes:
- Inertia: Resistance to changes in motion.
- Example: A book stays on a table until pushed.

#### Practical Insight:
- Seat belts counteract inertia during sudden stops.

## Second Law (F = ma)
- Force equals mass times acceleration.

### Notes:
- $ F = ma $: Net force determines acceleration.
- Unit of force: Newton ($ 1 \, \text{N} = 1 \, \text{kgÂ·m/s}^2 $).

#### Key Concept:
- Larger masses require more force for the same acceleration.

### Example Problem 1:
A $ 2 \, \text{kg} $ block experiences a net force of $ 10 \, \text{N} $. What is its acceleration?

**Solution:**
$$
a = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{m/s}^2
$$

## Third Law (Action-Reaction)
- Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

### Notes:
- Forces always occur in pairs.
- Example: Pushing against a wall exerts an equal force back on you.

#### Practical Insight:
- Rocket propulsion: Exhaust gases push backward; rocket moves forward.
