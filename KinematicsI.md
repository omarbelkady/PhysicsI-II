# Kinematics

## Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration
- Definitions and formulas:
  - $ v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} $
  - $ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} $

### Notes:
- **Displacement**: Change in position ($ \Delta x = x_f - x_i $).
- **Velocity**: Rate of change of displacement.
- **Acceleration**: Rate of change of velocity.

#### Key Concept:
- Positive acceleration increases velocity; negative acceleration (deceleration) decreases it.

#### Real-World Applications:
- Traffic Engineering: Calculates stopping distances for vehicles.
- Sports Science: Analyzes sprinter performance.

### Example Problem 1:
A car accelerates from rest to $ 20 \, \text{m/s} $ in $ 5 \, \text{s} $. What is its acceleration?

**Solution:**
$$
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{20 - 0}{5} = 4 \, \text{m/s}^2
$$

## Equations of Motion
- $ v = u + at $
- $ s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 $
- $ v^2 = u^2 + 2as $

### Notes:
- These equations apply to uniformly accelerated motion.
- $ u $: Initial velocity, $ v $: Final velocity, $ a $: Acceleration, $ s $: Displacement, $ t $: Time.

#### Practical Insight:
- Used in designing roller coasters, calculating stopping distances, etc.

#### Real-World Applications:
- Automotive Industry: Designs braking systems using kinematic equations.
- Space Exploration: Calculates rocket trajectories.

### Example Problem 2:
A ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of $ 20 \, \text{m/s} $. How high does it go? ($ g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 $)

**Solution:**
At maximum height, $ v = 0 $:
$$
v^2 = u^2 + 2as \implies 0 = (20)^2 + 2(-9.8)s
$$
$$
s = \frac{400}{19.6} \approx 20.4 \, \text{m}
$$

## Projectile Motion
- Horizontal and vertical components.

### Notes:
- Horizontal motion: Constant velocity ($ v_x = v_{x0} $).
- Vertical motion: Accelerated by gravity ($ a_y = -g $).

#### Key Concept:
- The path of a projectile is parabolic.

#### Real-World Applications:
- Ballistics: Analyzes bullet trajectories.
- Sports: Optimizes throwing angles for maximum range.

### Example Problem 3:
A ball is kicked horizontally at $ 10 \, \text{m/s} $ from a height of $ 20 \, \text{m} $. How far does it travel horizontally before hitting the ground?

**Solution:**
Vertical motion:
$$
h = \frac{1}{2}gt^2 \implies 20 = \frac{1}{2}(9.8)t^2 \implies t = \sqrt{\frac{40}{9.8}} \approx 2.02 \, \text{s}
$$
Horizontal motion:
$$
x = v_xt = (10)(2.02) \approx 20.2 \, \text{m}
$$
