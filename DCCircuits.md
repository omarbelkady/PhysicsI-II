# DC Circuits

## Series and Parallel Circuits
- Rules for resistors and capacitors.

### Notes:

- In series:


$$
R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 + \dots
$$

- In parallel:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{eq}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \dots
$$

### Example Problem 1:
Two resistors, $ R_1 = 4 \, \Omega $ and $ R_2 = 6 \, \Omega $, are connected in series. What is their equivalent resistance?

**Solution:**

$$
R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 = 4 + 6 = 10 \, \Omega
$$

## Kirchhoff's Laws
- Junction Rule: Total current entering = total current leaving.
- Loop Rule: Sum of voltage changes around a closed loop = 0.

### Notes:
- Use Kirchhoff's laws to analyze complex circuits.

### Example Problem 2:
In a circuit, a $ 12 \, \text{V} $ battery is connected to two resistors 

$$
R_1 = 4 \ \Omega ,  R_2 = 6 \ \Omega 
$$ 

in series. What is the current through the circuit?

**Solution:**

$$
R_{eq} = R_1 + R_2 = 4 + 6 = 10 \, \Omega
$$

$$
I = \frac{V}{R_{eq}} = \frac{12}{10} = 1.2 \, \text{A}
$$
