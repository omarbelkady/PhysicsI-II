# Constant Acceleration

## Key Notes
- Constant acceleration occurs when the rate of change of velocity remains constant.
- Equations of motion:

$$
v = u + at
$$

$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

$$
v^2 = u^2 + 2as
$$

## 1D Constant Acceleration

### Scenario: Car Braking

- A car traveling at $ 20 \, \text{m/s} $ applies brakes with deceleration $ 5 \, \text{m/s}^2 $. How far does it travel before stopping?

**Solution:**

Using 

$$
v^2 = u^2 + 2as 
$$

$$
0 = (20)^2 + 2(-5)s \implies s = \frac{400}{10} = 40 \, \text{m}
$$

### Real-World Application:
- Stopping distances for vehicles, elevators.

## 2D Constant Acceleration

### Scenario: Ball Rolling Down an Incline

- A ball rolls down a slope with acceleration $ 2 \, \text{m/s}^2 $. If it starts from rest, how far does it travel in $ 5 \, \text{s} $?

**Solution:**
Using 

$$
s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

$$
s = (0)(5) + \frac{1}{2}(2)(5)^2 = 25 \, \text{m}
$$

### Real-World Application:
- Roller coasters, skiing down slopes.

## 3D Constant Acceleration

### Scenario: Spacecraft Maneuvering
- A spacecraft accelerates uniformly in all three axes.

Given initial velocity components 

$$
v_{x0}, v_{y0}, v_{z0}
$$

and acceleration 

$$
a_x, a_y, a_z
$$

find position after time $ t $.

**Solution:**
Position components:

$$
x = v_{x0}t + \frac{1}{2}a_xt^2
$$

$$
y = v_{y0}t + \frac{1}{2}a_yt^2
$$

$$
z = v_{z0}t + \frac{1}{2}a_zt^2
$$

### Real-World Application:
- Space missions, satellite orbits.
