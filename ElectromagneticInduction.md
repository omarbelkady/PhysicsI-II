# Electromagnetic Induction

## Key Notes
- Faraday's Law states that a changing magnetic flux induces an electromotive force (EMF):
  $$
  \mathcal{E} = -N\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}
  $$
- Lenz's Law ensures the induced current opposes the change in flux.

## Connection to Work and Energy
- Induced EMF represents energy transfer from the magnetic field to the circuit.
- Generators convert mechanical energy into electrical energy through electromagnetic induction.

### Example Problem: Induced EMF
- A coil with $ N = 100 $ turns experiences a change in magnetic flux of $ \Delta \Phi = 0.02 \, \text{Wb} $ in $ \Delta t = 0.1 \, \text{s} $. What is the induced EMF?

**Solution:**
$$
\mathcal{E} = -N\frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = -(100)\frac{0.02}{0.1} = -20 \, \text{V}
$$

# Conservation of Energy in Electromagnetic Systems

## Key Notes
- The total energy in an electromagnetic system is conserved.
- Energy can be transferred between electric fields, magnetic fields, and other forms (e.g., kinetic, thermal).

---

## Connection to Work and Energy
- In LC circuits, energy oscillates between the electric field of the capacitor and the magnetic field of the inductor.
- In transformers, energy is transferred between primary and secondary coils with minimal loss.

### Example Problem: LC Oscillation
- A capacitor with initial charge $ Q_0 = 10 \, \mu\text{C} $ and capacitance $ C = 1 \, \mu\text{F} $ is connected to an inductor with $ L = 1 \, \text{H} $. What is the maximum energy stored in the capacitor?

**Solution:**
Maximum energy in the capacitor:
$$
U_{\text{max}} = \frac{Q_0^2}{2C} = \frac{(10 \times 10^{-6})^2}{2(1 \times 10^{-6})} = 5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{J}
$$

- Wireless charging: Energy is transferred via oscillating electromagnetic fields.
