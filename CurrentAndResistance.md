# Current and Resistance

## Electric Current
- $ I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} $

### Notes:
- Current is the rate of flow of charge.
- Unit: Ampere ($ 1 \, \text{A} = 1 \, \text{C/s} $).

### Example Problem 1:
If $ 0.5 \, \text{C} $ of charge flows through a wire in $ 2 \, \text{s} $, what is the current?

**Solution:**
$$
I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25 \, \text{A}
$$

## Ohm's Law
- $ V = IR $

### Notes:
- Voltage ($ V $) across a conductor is proportional to the current ($ I $) through it.
- Resistance ($ R $) is the proportionality constant.

### Example Problem 2:
A resistor has a resistance of $ 10 \, \Omega $. What is the voltage across it when a current of $ 2 \, \text{A} $ flows through it?

**Solution:**
$$
V = IR = (2)(10) = 20 \, \text{V}
$$

## Resistivity
- $ R = \rho\frac{L}{A} $

### Notes:
- Resistivity ($ \rho $) depends on the material.
- Longer wires or smaller cross-sectional areas increase resistance.

### Example Problem 3:
A copper wire has a resistivity of $ 1.7 \times 10^{-8} \, \Omega\text{m} $, length $ 10 \, \text{m} $, and cross-sectional area $ 2 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2 $. What is its resistance?

**Solution:**
$$
R = \rho\frac{L}{A} = (1.7 \times 10^{-8})\frac{10}{2 \times 10^{-6}} = 0.085 \, \Omega
$$
