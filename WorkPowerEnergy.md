# Work, Power, and Work-Energy Theorem

## Key Notes
- **Work**: $ W = Fd\cos\theta $, where $ \theta $ is the angle between force and displacement.
- **Power**: $ P = \frac{W}{t} $, measures the rate of doing work.
- **Work-Energy Theorem**: Net work equals change in kinetic energy:
  $$
  W_{\text{net}} = \Delta KE = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2
  $$

## 1D Work

### Scenario: Pushing a Box
- A force of $ 10 \, \text{N} $ pushes a box $ 5 \, \text{m} $. What is the work done?

**Solution:**
$$
W = Fd\cos\theta = (10)(5)\cos(0^\circ) = 50 \, \text{J}
$$

### Real-World Application:
- Moving furniture, pushing carts.

## 2D Work

### Scenario: Pulling a Sled
- A sled is pulled with a force of $ 50 \, \text{N} $ at $ 30^\circ $ to the horizontal for $ 10 \, \text{m} $. What is the work done?

**Solution:**
$$
W = Fd\cos\theta = (50)(10)\cos(30^\circ) = 433 \, \text{J}
$$

### Real-World Application:
- Towing vehicles, pulling luggage.

## 3D Work

### Scenario: Lifting a Load
- A crane lifts a load vertically with a force of $ 200 \, \text{N} $ while moving it horizontally $ 5 \, \text{m} $. What is the total work done?

**Solution:**
Vertical work:
$$
W_{\text{vertical}} = Fd = (200)(5) = 1000 \, \text{J}
$$
Horizontal work:
$$
W_{\text{horizontal}} = Fd\cos(90^\circ) = 0 \, \text{J}
$$
Total work:
$$
W_{\text{total}} = W_{\text{vertical}} + W_{\text{horizontal}} = 1000 \, \text{J}
$$

### Real-World Application:
- Construction cranes, elevators.

## Power

### Scenario: Motor Efficiency
- A motor does $ 500 \, \text{J} $ of work in $ 10 \, \text{s} $. What is its power output?

**Solution:**
$$
P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{500}{10} = 50 \, \text{W}
$$

### Real-World Application:
- Electric motors, fitness equipment.

## Work-Energy Theorem

### Scenario: Car Braking
- A car traveling at $ 20 \, \text{m/s} $ comes to rest. If the mass is $ 1000 \, \text{kg} $, what is the work done by the brakes?

**Solution:**
$$
W = \Delta KE = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_i^2
$$
$$
W = \frac{1}{2}(1000)(0)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(1000)(20)^2 = -200,000 \, \text{J}
$$
