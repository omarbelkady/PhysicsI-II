# Electric Fields

## Definition
- $ E = \frac{F}{q} $

### Notes:
- Electric field strength is a vector quantity.
- Direction is the force experienced by a positive test charge.

### Example Problem 1:
What is the electric field at a point where a $ +2 \, \mu\text{C} $ charge experiences a force of $ 0.04 \, \text{N} $?

**Solution:**
$$
E = \frac{F}{q} = \frac{0.04}{2 \times 10^{-6}} = 2 \times 10^4 \, \text{N/C}
$$

## Field Lines
- Direction and density indicate field strength.

### Notes:
- Field lines never cross.
- Closer lines indicate stronger fields.

### Example Problem 2:
Sketch the electric field lines around a positive point charge.

**Solution:**
Field lines radiate outward from the charge, evenly spaced in all directions.

## Superposition Principle
- Total field is the vector sum of individual fields.

### Notes:
- When multiple charges are present, their fields add vectorially.

### Example Problem 3:
Two charges, $ q_1 = +3 \, \mu\text{C} $ and $ q_2 = -2 \, \mu\text{C} $, are placed 0.2 m apart. Find the electric field at the midpoint between them.

**Solution:**
At the midpoint, distances to both charges are equal ($ r = 0.1 \, \text{m} $):
$$
E_1 = k\frac{q_1}{r^2} = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{3 \times 10^{-6}}{(0.1)^2} = 2.7 \times 10^6 \, \text{N/C}
$$
$$
E_2 = k\frac{q_2}{r^2} = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{2 \times 10^{-6}}{(0.1)^2} = 1.8 \times 10^6 \, \text{N/C}
$$
Since $ E_1 $ and $ E_2 $ are in opposite directions:
$$
E_{\text{net}} = E_1 - E_2 = 2.7 \times 10^6 - 1.8 \times 10^6 = 0.9 \times 10^6 \, \text{N/C}
$$
