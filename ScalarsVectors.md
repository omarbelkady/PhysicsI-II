# Scalars and Vectors

## Scalars
- Quantities with magnitude only (e.g., mass, temperature).

### Notes:
- Scalars are added algebraically.
- Examples: Speed, distance, energy, time.

#### Key Concept:
- Scalar quantities are independent of direction.

#### Real-World Applications:
- Temperature: Measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit.
- Distance: Used in navigation systems.

### Example Problem 1:
What is the sum of two scalar quantities, 5 kg and 10 kg?

**Solution:**
$$
5 \, \text{kg} + 10 \, \text{kg} = 15 \, \text{kg}
$$

## Vectors
- Quantities with magnitude and direction (e.g., velocity, force).

### Notes:
- Vectors require vector addition methods.
- Represented graphically as arrows, where length indicates magnitude and orientation indicates direction.

#### Applications:
- Navigation: Pilots use vectors to determine flight paths.
- Engineering: Forces acting on structures are vector quantities.

#### Real-World Applications:
- GPS Systems: Use vectors to calculate displacement.
- Structural Engineering: Analyze forces on bridges and buildings.

### Example Problem 2:
Find the resultant of two vectors, $ \vec{A} = 3 \, \text{m} $ east and $ \vec{B} = 4 \, \text{m} $ north.

**Solution:**
Using the Pythagorean theorem:
$$
R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5 \, \text{m}
$$
The direction is given by:
$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{B}{A}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) \approx 53.1^\circ \, \text{north of east}.
$$

## Components of a Vector
- Resolving vectors into x and y components.

### Notes:
- $ A_x = A\cos\theta $
- $ A_y = A\sin\theta $

#### Why Resolve Vectors?
- Simplifies calculations in 2D or 3D problems.
- Allows vector addition using components.

#### Real-World Applications:
- Projectile Motion: Breaking velocity into horizontal and vertical components.
- Robotics: Calculating movement in multiple directions.

### Example Problem 3:
Resolve a vector $ \vec{A} = 10 \, \text{m} $ at an angle of $ 30^\circ $ above the horizontal into its components.

**Solution:**
$$
A_x = 10\cos(30^\circ) = 10 \times 0.866 = 8.66 \, \text{m}
$$
$$
A_y = 10\sin(30^\circ) = 10 \times 0.5 = 5 \, \text{m}
$$
