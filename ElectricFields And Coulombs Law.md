# Electric Charge and Coulomb's Law

## Types of Charges
- Positive and Negative
- Like charges repel; opposite charges attract.

### Notes:
- Charge is quantized: $

$$
q = ne 
$$

where 

$$ 
e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} 
$$

- Conservation of charge: Total charge in a closed system remains constant.

### Example Problem 1:
Two charges

$$
q_1 = +2 \, \mu\text{C} 
$$ 

and 

$$
q_2 = -3 \, \mu\text{C} 
$$

are separated by 0.1 m. What is the force between them?

**Solution:**
Using Coulomb's Law:

$$
F = k\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}, \quad k = 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{C}^2
$$

$$
F = 9 \times 10^9 \times \frac{(2 \times 10^{-6})(3 \times 10^{-6})}{(0.1)^2} = 5.4 \, \text{N}
$$

## Coulomb's Law

$$ 
F = k\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}
$$

### Notes:

- The constant

$$
k = 9 \times 10^9 \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{C}^2
$$

- Force depends inversely on the square of the distance.

### Example Problem 2:
If the distance between two charges is doubled, what happens to the force?

**Solution:**
Since 

$$ 
F \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
$$

doubling the distance reduces the force by a factor of 

$$
2^2 = 4
$$

Thus, the new force is:

$$
\frac{1}{4}
$$ 

of the original.

## Conductors and Insulators
- Properties of materials.

### Notes:
- Conductors allow charge to flow freely (e.g., metals).
- Insulators prevent charge flow (e.g., rubber, glass).

### Example Problem 3:
Why does a balloon stick to a wall after being rubbed against hair?

**Solution:**
Rubbing transfers electrons, giving the balloon a net negative charge. This induces a positive charge on the wall, creating an attractive force.
