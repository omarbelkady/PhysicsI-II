    # Magnetic Fields and Work

## Key Notes
- Magnetic forces do no work on moving charges because the force is always perpendicular to the velocity.
- However, magnetic fields can influence motion indirectly by changing trajectories.

## Connection to Work and Energy
- While magnetic fields themselves do no work, they can guide particles in circular paths (e.g., cyclotrons) or induce currents (Faraday's Law), which involve energy transfer.

### Example Problem: Cyclotron Motion
- A proton moves in a uniform magnetic field of $ B = 0.5 \, \text{T} $ with a velocity of $ v = 10^6 \, \text{m/s} $. What is the radius of its circular path?

**Solution:**
The magnetic force provides the centripetal force:
$$
qvB = \frac{mv^2}{r} \implies r = \frac{mv}{qB}
$$
$$
r = \frac{(1.67 \times 10^{-27})(10^6)}{(1.6 \times 10^{-19})(0.5)} \approx 0.021 \, \text{m}
$$

### Real-World Application:
- Particle accelerators: Magnetic fields guide charged particles in circular paths.
- MRI machines: Use magnetic fields to align atomic nuclei for imaging.
