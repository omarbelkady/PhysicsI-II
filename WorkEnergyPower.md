# Work, Energy, and Power

## Work
- $ W = Fd\cos\theta $

### Notes:
- Work is done when a force causes displacement.
- $ \theta $: Angle between force and displacement.

#### Key Concept:
- No work is done if displacement is perpendicular to the force.

### Example Problem 1:
A force of $ 10 \, \text{N} $ moves an object $ 5 \, \text{m} $ along the direction of the force. What is the work done?

**Solution:**
$$
W = Fd\cos\theta = (10)(5)\cos(0^\circ) = 50 \, \text{J}
$$

## Energy
- Kinetic Energy: $ KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $
- Potential Energy: $ PE = mgh $

### Notes:
- Energy can be transferred but not created or destroyed (Conservation of Energy).
- Kinetic energy depends on motion; potential energy depends on position.

#### Practical Insight:
- Hydroelectric dams convert gravitational potential energy into electrical energy.

### Example Problem 2:
A $ 2 \, \text{kg} $ object falls from a height of $ 10 \, \text{m} $. What is its kinetic energy just before hitting the ground?

**Solution:**
Potential energy converts to kinetic energy:
$$
PE = mgh = (2)(9.8)(10) = 196 \, \text{J}
$$
$$
KE = PE = 196 \, \text{J}
$$

## Power
- $ P = \frac{W}{t} $

### Notes:
- Power measures the rate of doing work.
- Unit: Watt ($ 1 \, \text{W} = 1 \, \text{J/s} $).

#### Key Concept:
- Higher power means faster energy transfer.

### Example Problem 3:
A motor does $ 500 \, \text{J} $ of work in $ 10 \, \text{s} $. What is its power?

**Solution:**
$$
P = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{500}{10} = 50 \, \text{W}
$$
