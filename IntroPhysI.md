# Introduction to Physics

## What is Physics?
- The study of matter, energy, and their interactions.
- Fundamental science that underpins other sciences.

### Notes:
- Physics seeks to explain natural phenomena through laws and principles.
- It uses mathematics as its language to describe relationships between physical quantities.

### Example Problem 1:
A car travels 200 km in 4 hours. What is its average speed?

**Solution:**
$$
v = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{200 \, \text{km}}{4 \, \text{h}} = 50 \, \text{km/h}
$$

## Branches of Physics
- Classical Mechanics
- Thermodynamics
- Electromagnetism
- Quantum Mechanics
- Relativity

### Notes:
- Classical Mechanics deals with motion and forces.
- Thermodynamics studies heat and energy transfer.

### Example Problem 2:
Which branch of physics explains why a ball falls to the ground when dropped?

**Solution:**
This is explained by **Classical Mechanics**, specifically Newton's Law of Gravitation.

## Importance of Units
- SI Units: Meter (m), Kilogram (kg), Second (s)
- Dimensional Analysis

### Notes:
- SI units ensure consistency in scientific measurements.
- Dimensional analysis helps verify equations.

### Example Problem 3:
Convert 50 miles per hour (mph) to meters per second (m/s).

**Solution:**
1 mile = 1609.34 meters, 1 hour = 3600 seconds.
$$
50 \, \text{mph} = 50 \times \frac{1609.34}{3600} = 22.35 \, \text{m/s}
$$
